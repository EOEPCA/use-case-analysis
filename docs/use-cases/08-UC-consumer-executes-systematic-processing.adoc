= Consumer executes Systematic processing

This use case builds upon case <<Consumer discovers and executes On-demand Processing Service>>.

As a Consumer, I want to setup an automated processing task that will be triggered for systematic execution by the platform (on behalf of the user). The triggering event(s) shall include:

* According to a time schedule (daily, weekly, etc.)
* Arrival of specific new input data
* External event trigger (e.g. earthquake alert trigger)

I want to utilise the EP's discovery service to select a processing service. I want to utlise the EP's discovery service to select input dataset(s). I want to define my systematic processing by specification of the triggering event for automated processing. I should be alerted that the systematic processing has been triggered. I would like to monitor the status of the processing, receive the completed _Processing Results_, with the ability to visualise/download etc. the results using the facilities of the EP. In the case of an error, then I should be alerted, with the capability to investigate the cause through access to the processing logs.

'''

. Consumer logs in on the EP
. *Discover and Select Processing Service...*
. Consumer discovers and selects a Processing Service as described in use case <<Consumer discovers and executes On-demand Processing Service>>. _Steps not repeated here._
. Alternatively, the Consumer selects a processing service from their Workspace
. *Discover and Select Input Data...*
. Consumer discovers and selects Input Data as described in use case <<Consumer discovers and executes On-demand Processing Service>>. _Steps not repeated here._
. Alternatively, the Consumer selects input data from their Workspace
. *Define Systematic Processing...*
. Consumer specifies the input parameters of the _Processing Service_
. Consumer specifies the systematic processing triggering conditions
. Optionally, the Consumer defines a collection of data to which the results have to be included
. The EP checks that the Consumer has the authorisation to launch the _Processing Service_ and access the specified data
. The EP estimates the future cost/duration of the processing and checks the Consumer has enough resources to execute the processing. See <<note-systematic-processing-cost>> below.
. Consumer is presented with the cost/duration estimation and confirms the systematic processing
. *Execute Systematic Processing...*
. EP initiates systematic processing according to the defined trigger condition
. Consumer monitors the status of the systematic processing (%completion, execution logs)
. When the processing completes successfully the _Processing Results_ are made available to the user in their _Workspace_ and/or the target _Collection_ selected by the user
. The Consumer's billing account is updated comensurate with the 'cost' of the systematic processing
. Optionally, the EP notifies the Consumer of the occurrence and completion of the systematic processing
. *_Alternative Flow:_* <<aflow-systematic-processing-error>>
. *Exploit Results...*
. Optionally, the Consumer downloads the results
. Optionally, the Consumer visualises the processing logs (e.g. for error inspection)
. Optionally, the Consumer visualises the results and is able to manipulate and parameterise the view - with the possibility to download the result of their visualisation
. Optionally, the Consumer publishes their results in the catalogue - specifying all necessary metadata to support discovery

In the case of errors during systematic processing

.. EP checks for errors during the processing
.. Consumer is alerted to errors occuring during the systematic processing
.. Consumer accesses systematic processing logs to investigate the error cause
.. (Optionally) Consumer diagnoses problem and resubmits corrected systematic processing definition. _This assumes that the error cause was under the control of the Consumer, i.e. they made an input error._

.Systematic Processing Costs
NOTE: Given that the systematic processing occurs asynchronous to the Consumer submitting the definition, the possibility exists that, at time of trigger/execution, the Consumer no longer has sufficient resources to cover the task. This condition must be trapped and handled by the EP - perhaps raising an error to the Consumer. See alternative flow <<aflow-systematic-processing-error>>.
