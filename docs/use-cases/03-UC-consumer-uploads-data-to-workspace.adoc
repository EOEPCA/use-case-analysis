= Consumer uploads data to their workspace

As a Consumer I want to upload data into my workspace and specify the name and destination in the target EP. I would like to treat my uploaded data the same as other (existing) data available in the EP. This includes:

* Visualise the data in the platform
* Use the data as input to analysis activities, e.g. interactively or through processing services

Additionally, I would like to (optionally) publish the data so that it is available to other users, discoverable through the EP catalogue.

The following figures provide implementation examples from the Hydrology TEP, https://hydrology-tep.eu/.

<<img_manageMyData>> demonstrates the invocation of the 'Manage My Data' application.

'''

. Consumer logs in on the EP
. Consumer navigates to their Workspace to be presented with data they have previously uploaded or 'saved'
. Consumer requests to upload new data - specifying appropriate metadata including the location to which the data should be uploaded
. Platform confirms the user's rights before accepting the request and ingesting the data into the user's workspace
. Optionally, consumer can view the details of any data in their workspace, including that which they have uploaded
. Optionally, consumer visualises their uploaded data and is able to manipulate and parameterise the view - with the possibility to download the result of their visualisation
. Optionally, consumer publishes the uploaded data in the catalogue - specifying all necessary metadata to support discovery
