= Consumer analyses value-added product

This use-case is described in document <<EP-UC>>. However, it is seen as the same as use-case <<Consumer discovers and executes Interactive Applications>>, just with particular emphasis on the inclusion of Value-added Products in the analysis, and perhaps with an associated set of specific tooling in mind (WebGIS, DataCube, etc.).

By way of illustration, <<img_valueAddedProducts>> provides an example that uses PUMA WebGIS to combine value-added products with in-situ data, taken from the Urban TEP platform.
