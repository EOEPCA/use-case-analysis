= Consumer performs Open Science

As a Consumer I want to share my analysis and processing results in such a way that facilitates scientific collaboration. I want to link my results to a scientific publication, and assign a DOI to my results to reference it in my scientific paper. I want to encapsulate my research/analysis as a _Reusable Research Object_, to capture all aspects of my analysis including data used and processing performed etc., so that it can be reproduced, I can re-use my analysis in the future, or share it with others for collaboration. A simple example could be a Jupyter notebook that captures an annotated analysis, identifying input data, executing code to transform the data, and presenting/visualising the output results. This case should then be generalised for execution of more complex analyses using platform data / processing services (local and external).

<<img_openScience>> illustrates a shared analysis result linked to a reference scientific publication.

'''

. Consumer logs in on the EP
. Consumer selects items (e.g. data, processing services, processing results)
. EP verifies that Consumer has right to share the item
. Consumer selects one of the collaborative options, including:
.. share processing results
.. link to scientific publication
.. create a Reusable Research Object for sharing
.. Others TBD - see note <<note-collaboration-options>>.
. Consumer specifies collaborators and associated access rights (read/write - user/group/everyone). See note <<note-collaboration-groups>>.
. The EP shares the item according to the Consumers specification
. Optionally, the EP registers a DOI for the item
. Optionally, collaborators are automatically notified of the sharing of the item
. Collaborators access the shared item; the EP checks that the Consumer is authorised to access the item

[[note-collaboration-options, Collaboration Options]]
.Collaboration Options
NOTE: Each of the 'collaborative options' needs to be defined in more detail, and perhaps explored through additional use cases.

[[note-collaboration-groups, Collaboration Groups]]
.Collaboration Groups
NOTE: This use case assumes the concept of 'collaborators'. This implies a grouping of users that needs to be explored in further details through additional use cases.
