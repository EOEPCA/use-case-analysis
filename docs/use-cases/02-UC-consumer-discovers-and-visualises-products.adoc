= Consumer discovers and visualises products

As a Consumer I want to search for Products of all types by specification of textual and faceted search criteria. I want to be able to incrementally narrow my search with more criteria clauses. The data/products available to the user should not be limited to EO data - it should be possible for the user to augment their processing/analysis with data from other sources such as in-situ sensor data, lidar etc. For each Product in the search result I want to get more detailed information that describes the product, its usage terms and costs, and visualise the data graphically. Having discovered a product of interest I may 'save' it to my Workspace, download it, or use it as input to further exploitation activities.

'''

. Consumer logs in on the EP
. Consumer begins searching for products on the EP. The starting point is the full unfiltered product set that contains commercial/non-commercial EO data, value-added products and additional data such as in-situ sensor measurements
. Optionally, the resultset is automatically filtered to include only those collections that the Consumer has right to visualise. _It may be the case that the EP chooses to make these 'unavailable collections' visible to the Consumer to publicise their existence_
. Consumer filters the resultset by any combination of textual search terms, area of interest, time of interest, selection of collection(s) and selection of product facets
. Consumer incrementally adjusts their search criteria to refine the filtered resultset
. Consumer selects a product of interest; the EP checks they are authorised to access the product
. Consumer views detailed metadata for the selected product
. Consumer views T&Cs for the service and accepts terms if not already done so
. Optionally, the Consumer 'saves' (a reference to) the product to their workspace
. Consumer requests the cost for access/usage of the data
. Optionally, the Consumer visualises the product with a graphical representation. _The Consumer is able to parameterise the visualisation interactively, e.g. specification of layers to view etc._
. Optionally, the Consumer downloads the visualisation results

[[aflow-arrival-from-google, User Discovers Resources using a General-Purpose Search Engine]]
.Alternative Flow: User Discovers Resources using a General-Purpose Search Engine

A User, who may be unaware of the platform, may begin searching for products using a search engine such as Google. The User may then follow a link directly to a product-related page.


[big]#*Notes*#

[[note-guest-user, Guest User]]
.Guest User
NOTE: The use case does not mention the Guest user. It should be taken into account that an EP may choose to allow limited access to a Guest user, such as searching/browsing catalogues, before insisting on user login for exploitation activities. _This approach might be typical in order to allow a potential user discover EP capabilities before signing up_

[[note-seo, Search Engine Indexing]]
.Search Engine Indexing
NOTE: To facilitate Users discovering products and the EP as a whole using a search engine it's necessary to allow search engines to effectively index them. This requires Guest access to as much as possible but also extends further to other SEO requirements.

[[note-data-subsetting, Data Sub-setting]]
.Data Sub-setting
NOTE: The use case does not consider the case where the Consumer is able to select sub-setting (spatial/temporal) of the data product itself, which might be typical of data accessible through a service such as OPeNDAP. _The extent to which this case should be considered for the EP is TBD_
