<p>Having initiated execution of a <em>Processing Service</em>, I would like to monitor its progress (including any errors occurring), and have access to the results output at the successful conclusion.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Consumer I want to list and search for commercial and non-commercial <em>Interactive Applications</em>, by specification of textual and faceted search criteria. I want to be able to incrementally narrow my search with more criteria clauses. For each <em>Interactive Application</em> in the search result I want to get more detailed information, including a description and access to its execution manual. If I have not already done so, then any <em>Terms &amp; Conditions</em> associated to usage of the <em>Interactive Application</em> should be made clear to me, with the opportunity for me to accept the T&amp;Cs before I am authorised to execute the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having started the <em>Interactive Application</em> I want to access the application user interface via my web browser, perform analytics accessing EO data, value-added products and other resources available on or outside the platform. I would like to export my Analysis Results (text, products, screenshots etc.) from the application into my EP workspace, allowing me to visualise and download the results. At the conclusion of my analysis session I would like to stop the application to ensure that I am not using unecessary resources and/or incurring unwanted costs.</p>

<p>As a Consumer, I should be able to request a list of Interactive Application sessions that I currently have 'live' in the system - through which I can manage the sessions by rejoining or stopping as required.</p>
